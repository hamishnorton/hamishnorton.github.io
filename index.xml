      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s the point of having countless books and libraries, whose titles could hardly be read through in a lifetime. The learner is not taught, but burdened by the sheer volume, and it&amp;rsquo;s better to plant the seeds of a few authors than to be scattered about by many.</description>

      <description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t really give my craft the focus it deserved, until I discovered my purpose. Your purpose tends to evolve with time.
 my purpose: Make It Easier For Others
my craft: Software Solution Development
 Once I started really applying myself to my craft I noticed that a lot of what I had percievedd problems fell away.</description>

The next time you have to do that thing it&amp;rsquo;ll be easier as you&amp;rsquo;ve make the effort now to setup it to reduce the effort/overhead of having to do it all again.</description>

      <description>Yaml is probably the briefest common structured text data representation. And thus it&amp;rsquo;s often a go to for configuration, build and other pipeline files. It&amp;rsquo;s basically made up of lists of key:value pairs.
