	Yaml is probably the briefest common structured text data representation. And thus it&rsquo;s often a go to for configuration, build and other pipeline files. It&rsquo;s basically made up of lists of key:value pairs.

 my purpose: Make It Easier For Others
my craft: Software Solution Development
 Once I started really applying myself to my craft I noticed that a lot of what I had percievedd problems fell away. <a class="read-more" href="/stash/craftsmanship/">read more</a>

	I&rsquo;ve included Productivity as an aspect. It encompasses all the things that &ldquo;Make it easyier for later&rdquo;. The next time you have to do that thing it&rsquo;ll be easier as you&rsquo;ve make the effort now to setup it to reduce the effort/overhead of having to do it all again. <a class="read-more" href="/stash/productivity/">read more</a>

	What&rsquo;s the point of having countless books and libraries, whose titles could hardly be read through in a lifetime. The learner is not taught, but burdened by the sheer volume, and it&rsquo;s better to plant the seeds of a few authors than to be scattered about by many. <a class="read-more" href="/stash/great-books/">read more</a>

	The following rough guide to DevOps, and notes I&rsquo;ve made while compemplating how DevOps works, fits in, adds value to a business.
I&rsquo;ve had the question posed to me often &ldquo;Well, what is DevOps, anyway&rdquo;?
