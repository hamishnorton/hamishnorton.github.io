		<p>The other day on the way to work I had an idea.  Well two ideas from others and putting them together.</p>
<h2 id="use-rating-without-the-7">Use Rating Without The 7</h2>
<p>Use the 1 to 10 rating scale, but you are not allowed to us the number 7.  By eliminating the 7, you have to make that call to rate it; up a bit or down a bit, not just a <em>&ldquo;meh&rdquo;</em> of average, and it forces you to make that call.  I first heard about this concept on <a href="https://tim.blog/podcast/">The Tim Ferriss Show</a>, and he may have attributed it from someone else.</p>
<h2 id="the-3-aspects-of-motivation">The 3 Aspects of Motivation</h2>
<p>Motivation is made up of:</p>
<ul>
<li>A chance to master a skill</li>
<li>Having a autonomy</li>
<li>Having a purpose</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="an-indication-of-motivation">An Indication of Motivation</h2>
<p>So to get an indication of my teams motivation I asked them, including myself, to rate each aspect of motivation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m grateful we all responded with 6&rsquo;s and 8&rsquo;s for both Mastery, and Autonomy.  However <em>Purpose</em> we coincidentally all put down 5.<br>
We talked about <em>Our Purpose</em> a bit and it&rsquo;s explainable, but we do need to do something about it. We&rsquo;re currently trying to complete a piece of work to upgrade a set of applications which is making things better for later, but also really hampering us from adding value to the business.</p>
<p>We realize we also need to work on engagement with the business more.  It&rsquo;ll come soon, and we can review our values periodically to check that we are all motivated.</p>
<p>On an individual level if any of my team reported a 4 or less then I&rsquo;d really want to have a good chat with them to figure out what&rsquo;s not working for them, and what we could try to improve the situations.  I also let the team know that if they ever feel that they have a value 4 or less for one of the aspects then they can use that as a starting point to conversation with me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if this is the best way to check in with members of a team, but it&rsquo;s a way it can be done.  And h</p>
