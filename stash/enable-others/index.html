		<blockquote>
<p>principle: Enable Others</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an overarching principle, and is applied in several ways.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;ll do a job for someone, but instead make what they do easier by enabling them so they don&rsquo;t need you again.  As a craftsman I do this by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communicating concisely and clearly, leading them in</li>
<li>Choosing to call people whenever the communication may require an exchange of dialogue</li>
<li>Creating code that is: simple, obvious and readable</li>
<li>Leaving code in a better state than when I found it</li>
<li>Provide high level documentation that leads others into the detail</li>
<li>Developing solutions that make it easier for them to do their work</li>
</ul>
<p>To apply this as a principle I found it best to think of it as an <em>Ideal</em> in that it&rsquo;s something you strive for, but don&rsquo;t want to burn all of your time doing it perfectly.  The focus of what you do to <em>Enable Others</em> needs to be on providing them with <em>what is essential</em>.</p>
<p>The easier you make it for them, the less they&rsquo;ll need you.  You&rsquo;ll be able to get on with focused work that adds value.</p>
<p>You will have provided them an opportunity to easily pick up something new, and be successful at it.</p>
