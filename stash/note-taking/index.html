		<p>Note-taking, it&rsquo;s an important part of your personal informatino system, allowing you to either come back to useful information and or develop your thoughts on something over time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using EverNote pretty happierly for quite a while now.  It&rsquo;s a well thought, and flexible enough to support systems such as <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/">GTD</a>.  But for me, it falls short in a couple of areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>The content doesn&rsquo;t paste very well to other sources. It often requires further formatting</li>
<li>It doesn&rsquo;t support MarkDown</li>
<li>It doesn&rsquo;t support structured data</li>
<li>It provide a Kanban view</li>
</ul>
<p>So off on a hunt I went, to see if there was another Note-taking application that would meet my needs.  While on the hunt I discovered what I&rsquo;m criteria really was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Available and synchronised on all of my devices; Android phone and tablet, both Windows 10 work and personal</li>
<li>A web clipper extension for Chrome and Firefox</li>
<li>Markdown as the default</li>
<li>You can copy and paste from it without reformatting (pretty much implied if it stores the content as MarkDown)</li>
<li>Available offline</li>
<li>Well developed and current</li>
<li>The ability to easily access multiple notes at once, such as; each note as a file, or an API</li>
</ul>
<p>What this last critria really meant was I&rsquo;d be happy to pay for it (given I am now with EverNote Premium anyway) if it could give me with the right access.  Or I&rsquo;d choose an application that allowed me to determine where my notes would be saved, these were typically open source applications as well.</p>
<p>The following appeared to be possible contenters:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://notable.app/">Notable</a></li>
<li><a href="https://joplinapp.org/">Joplin</a></li>
<li><a href="https://boostnote.io/">Boost Note</a></li>
<li><a href="https://simplenote.com/">Simplenote</a></li>
<li><a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Another thought I had was &ldquo;Do I actually need an application for this, if my notes are just MarkDown?&rdquo;  Perhaps I could use a bunch of files commited to a git repo, or use synchronised cloud file storage.  How would I search through my notes?  I could use the search feature in a cloud git host?  How would I search when offline?  This could all be done.  But wait &ldquo;If this was easy what would it look like?&rdquo;.  I&rsquo;d just use an application.</p>
<p>After a bit more considered and bit of trialing of some of the contenders I&rsquo;ve settled on given Joplin ago for a while.  So far so good, it synchroised my notes to my OneDrive, and each note is a single MarkDown file.  There is also a web clipper, which I haven&rsquo;t tried yet, that will convert the HTML of the page to MarkDown.</p>
<p>I still have quite away to feel like I&rsquo;ve got a well functioning personal information operating system working, in that it has other fasits to it not just Note-taking.  I will say, and it&rsquo;s pretty obvious, that Note-taking is a corner stone of anyones personal information operating system.</p>
