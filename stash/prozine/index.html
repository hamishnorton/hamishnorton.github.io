		<p>This site <em>ProZine</em> is not just a web version take on a Zine, in that it&rsquo;s about <strong>Mastery</strong>, <strong>Purpose</strong>, <strong>Fulfilment</strong> and <strong>Productivity</strong>.  It&rsquo;s also about sharing a bit of my story and challenges in the hope that helps other to lead a better life.</p>
<p>The project of starting this site, has a couple key challenges; On the fullstack developer spectrum I&rsquo;m far more near the backend, and I&rsquo;m no writer.</p>
<h2 id="the-writting-challenge">The Writting Challenge</h2>
<p>For 6th Form English at high school I got the 9.  If you&rsquo;re from my error you&rsquo;ll know just about bad that is.  I&rsquo;ve been told it&rsquo;s harder to get than the top grade of a 1.  Anyhow, I&rsquo;ve probably done alright since then, having realised how important effective communication is.  But I&rsquo;ve never written anything much that&rsquo;s public, or that I&rsquo;ve wanted to be public.  In this case I want to share what I&rsquo;ve discovered and learnt, as I&rsquo;ve benefited from all those that have already shared.  So the writting challenge is to improve my ability to write for you the reader so what I share helps you without taking up to much of your time.</p>
<h2 id="the-technical-challenge">The Technical Challenge</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m no front end developer, that&rsquo;s for sure.  I know some of the basics of HTML and CSS.  And I&rsquo;ve done okay writting TypeScript on a project before.</p>
<p>In choosing a technology stack I&rsquo;ve asked my self <em>&ldquo;If this was easy what would it look like?&quot;</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>principle: If this was easy, what would it look like?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This has lead to the following decisions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Instaed of using a Content Management System (CMS), I have choosen a Static Site Generator.</li>
<li>Of the Static Site Generators out there I&rsquo;ve chosen <a href="%5Bgohugo.io%5D(https://gohugo.io)">Hugo</a>, as I&rsquo;ve used it a little bit in the past, see it&rsquo;s has matured and has quite a good following.  I considered <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">Gatsby</a> as I believe <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMStack</a> is a pretty smart way to deliver content and applications as one.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ll use a CSS framework to assist with the rapidly styling the site.  I&rsquo;ve choose <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">BootStrap</a> as it&rsquo;s popular, the documentation is pretty good, and there are plenty of sites using it that can be used as examples.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;m also very keen to balance myself out on the fullstack spectrum by picking up enough front end skills so that I have a complete toolset that I can use to rapidly pull together an application in the future.</p>
