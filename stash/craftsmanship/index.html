		<p>I didn&rsquo;t really give my craft the focus it deserved until I discovered my purpose.  One&rsquo;s purpose tends to evolve with time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>purpose: Make It Easier For Others<br>
craft: Software Solution Development</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once I&rsquo;d started really applying myself to my craft I noticed that a lot of what I had been percieving situation problems fell away.  Decissions at work became easier to make, as I could simply ask myself as a craftsman what is the right thing to do.  You&rsquo;ll notice I added the word <strong>Solution</strong> into my craft as I&rsquo;m not here to just write code, I&rsquo;m here to develop solutions that make a difference to the people that use them and provide value.</p>
