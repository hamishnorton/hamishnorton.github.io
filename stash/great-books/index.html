<p>What&rsquo;s the point of having countless books and libraries, whose titles could hardly be read through in a lifetime. The learner is not taught, but burdened by the sheer volume, and it&rsquo;s better to plant the seeds of a few authors than to be scattered about by many.<br>
~Seneca, <em>On Tranquillity of Mind</em>, 9.4</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following list is a set of books that I&rsquo;ve found quite useful.  There are so many more that I&rsquo;d like to read and hope to get too.  I&rsquo;ve taken to following a Tim Ferriss like approach, where he only chooses books that have been out for more than a year, and has a high number of good reviews.</p>
<h2 id="its-good-to-be-you">It&rsquo;s Good To Be You</h2>
<ul>
<li>Guy Martin My Autobiography ~Guy Martin</li>
<li>Worms To Catch ~Guy Martin</li>
<li>When You Dead You Dead -Guy Martin</li>
<li>The Subtle Art Of Not Giving A F*ck ~Mark Manson</li>
</ul>
<p>My wife bought me first of the Guy Martin books after I started watching a bunch of his videos.  He&rsquo;s pretty is own man, doing his own thing, and you can see how grounded he is.  Yeah, he&rsquo;s a bit old, but that doesn&rsquo;t matter, does it.</p>
<h2 id="software-craftsmanship">Software Craftsmanship</h2>
<ul>
<li>Clean Architecture ~Robert C. Martin (aka Uncle Bob)</li>
<li>The Pragmatic Programmer ~David Thomas &amp; Andrew Hunt</li>
<li>The Software Craftsman ~Sandro Mancuso</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="devops">DevOps</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Goal ~Eliyahu M. Goldratt and Jeff Cox</li>
<li>The Unicorn Project ~Gene Kim</li>
<li>The Phoenix Project ~Gene Kim</li>
</ul>
<p>These 3 books are all stories designed to get concepts across, making for a fun read.  <em>The Goal</em> isn&rsquo;t about DevOps bit it&rsquo;s key to understanding constraints.  Gene Kim&rsquo;s books fun reads that aren&rsquo;t just about key concepts of DevOps, but also over coming the non-technical organisation challenges of getting the work done.</p>
<h2 id="discovering-the-stoics">Discovering The Stoics</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Obstacle Is The Way ~Ryan Holiday</li>
<li>Ego Is The Enemy ~Ryan Holiday</li>
<li>The Daily Stoic 365 Meditations On Wisdom, Perseverance, And The Art Of Living ~Ryan Holiday</li>
<li>Life to the Fullest ~Darrin Donnelly</li>
<li>Think Like A Warrior ~Darrin Donnelly</li>
<li>Victory Favors The Fearless ~Darrin Donnelly</li>
<li>Old School Grit ~Darrin Donnelly</li>
<li>Relentless Optimism ~Darrin Donnelly</li>
<li>Tribe Of Mentors ~Tim Ferriss</li>
</ul>
<p>I think, I first heard about <a href="https://ryanholiday.net/">Ryan Holiday</a> work in a podcast on <a href="https://tim.blog/podcast/">The Tim Ferriss Show</a>.</p>
<p>Darrin Donnelly&rsquo;s books are sporting stories of a challenging situation is overcome by a particular focused approach.  I found they inspired a bit of confidence and that values presented align well with those of the stoics.</p>
<h2 id="productivity">Productivity</h2>
<ul>
<li>Deep Work ~Cal Newport</li>
</ul>
<p>Cal Newport&rsquo;s book is a great mix of historical stories and practical advice.  As a result it made it pretty easy for me to figure out how to apply aspects to my own life, and improve my throughput.</p>
<h2 id="sailing">Sailing</h2>
<ul>
<li>Higher Performance Sailing ~Frank Bethwaite</li>
<li>Fast Handling Technique ~Frank Bethwaite</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, so a little bit off topic from developing software solutions, but these are so good, and must reads if you&rsquo;re looking to pickup how some key dynamics of sailing work.</p>
<h2 id="good-reads">Good Reads</h2>
<p>The following are good reads, they are not great, well, weren&rsquo;t for me at the time.  However they may grab your interest.  I&rsquo;ve found the suitability of a book for me sometimes quite reflective of where I&rsquo;m at with my own level of learning.</p>
<ul>
<li>Slipstream Time Hacking ~Benjamin P. Hardy</li>
<li>We Need To Weaken The Mixture ~Guy Martin</li>
<li>Stillness Is The Key ~Ryan Holiday</li>
<li>How To Lead When You&rsquo;re Not In Charge ~Clay Scroggins</li>
<li>Zen And The Art Of Motorcycle Maintenance ~Robert Pirsig</li>
</ul>
